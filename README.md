# Calculator Application
An implementation of a simple virtual calculator with game design elements. Made with Unity. Available for PC, Mac, Linux, and Andriod.
## Purpose
The purpose of this application is to demonstrate the developer's core competencies in software design, algorithm implementation, C# programming, Unity development, unit testing, programming best practices, GitHub/GitHub Desktop, and technical writing. It was created as an educational tool and as a portfolio piece. 
## Installation
For PC, Mac, and Linux:
1. Download CalculatorApplication-[version #].zip from the latest release page.
2. Unzip the package to a local directory and open the unzipped package.
3. Open the subdirectory for your system. 

   a. If you are using Windows, select either the 32-bit or 64-bit subdirectory depending on your system architecture.
4. Run the application. 

   a. For Windows, run "CalculatorApplication.exe"
   
   b. For Mac, run "CalculatorApplication-v1.0.0.app"
   
   c. For Linux, run "CalculatorApplication-v1.0.0.x86_64"

For Andriod:
1. Download "CalculatorApplication-v1.0.0.apk" on your Andriod device.
2. Open and install the application.

## Usage
Upon opening the application, you will be presented with a virtual calculator. Click or tap the calculator buttons to enter expressions into the calculator, then press "=" to calculate the result of those expressions.

The calculator display screen has a button labeled "Custom Operations..." This button will open a dialog allowing you to choose from a small selection of more complex calculations, such as finding the factorial of an integer. Once you select a custom operation, you will be presented with a description of the operation and instructions to conduct the operation. In general, you can use the "=" button to move to the next argument, and the "C/CE" button to clear the current argument and move to the previous argument. The result of the custom operation will be displayed on the calculator GUI.

The calculator display screen has a second button labeled "Backspace" that allows you to delete the most recent token entered into the calculator.

You may quit the application using the "Quit" button located in the bottom right corner of the calculator display.
